# Hurricane-Analysis
### Project Goals
I will work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

I will write a function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest damage, and how costly it was.

Lastly, I created a scale to rate hurricanes according to how much damage they cause.
